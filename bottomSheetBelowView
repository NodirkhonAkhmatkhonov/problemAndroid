I faced a problem with bottom sheet. The bottom sheet was always below any view which made me do some research through the net
and ended up with fail. But finally Android Studio suggestion helped me get out of swamp :) I used attribute 'clickable'
for the view which was considered to be bottom sheet. But I didn't use attribute 'focusable'. That was the solution for 
the problem. Alhamdulillah!
